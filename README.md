# FractureProof
A three step process for feature selection using principal component analysis, random forests, and recursive feature selection for public health informatics. 

## Real World Feature Selection
For many health outcomes, there are many possible causes with large quantites of observed variables. In order to find these possible but unknown causes, an analysis of structured datasets containling large numbers of variables (N > 1000), multiple dimensions, different variable types, and chunks of missing data. Also, this analysis is only beneficial if it can be easily translated into translatable practice. 

The FracureProof process uses open source machine learning algorithms to select important features (variables/columns) with these existing constraints. The result is a list of features that can be input into a validation method like risk prediction or regression. 

## Improving Public Health
FractureProof is a process that uses open source tools and publically available data so any entity focused on the improvement of the public health can utilize the process. This project fits inside two different doamins within public health research: Precision Public Health and Public Health Informatics.   

### Precision Public Health
"M Khoury, the Director of Office of Public Health Genomics at the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC), defined ‘precision’ in the context of public health as “improving the ability to prevent disease, promote health, and reduce health disparities in populations by: 
1) applying emerging methods and technologies for measuring disease, pathogens, exposures, behaviors, and susceptibility in populations; 2) developing policies and targeted implementation programs to improve health” (Prosperi M, 2019).

This process is designed to implement a methodlogy for easy analysis of public data to determine important elements associated with a health outcome. These outputs can tailored be provided to practicioners and researchers informative elements for the improvement of program or policy. 

### Public Health Informatics
"Public health informatics (PHI) has been described as the field that optimizes the use of information to improve individual health, health care, public health practice, biomedical and health services research, and health policy" (Edmunds M, 2014).
